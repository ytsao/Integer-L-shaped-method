             Objects of class <c>Column</c> create a variable
             to use in column-wise modeling.
             </summary>
            <remarks>
             <p>In column-wise modeling, newly
             constructed variables are inserted into existing
             modeling objects. The term column-wise comes from linear programming, where
             the constraints are typically represented as a matrix. Adding new
             variables to the optimization problem corresponds to adding columns to
             the constraint matrix.</p>
             <p>
             The procedure for column-wise modeling is as follows.
             Start from an existing set of modeling objects of these classes: </p>
             <ul>
             <li><c>IObjective</c>,</li>
             <li><c>IRange</c>, and</li>
             <li><c>ILPMatrix</c></li>
             </ul>
             <p>
             For each modeling object affected by the addition of the new variable,
             call the method <c>IMPModeler.Column</c> 
             with the object as an argument,
             along with the other arguments needed to install a new variable in the
             existing modeling objects.  See the documentation of the
             
              IMPModeler.Column 
             methods for the details of
             these arguments. Each of these methods returns an object of type
             
              Column 
             that contains information about how to add a new
             variable to the modeling object for which the
             
              IMPModeler.Column 
             method has been called.</p>
             <p>
             The column objects can then be linked to an aggregate
             column object by the method 
             
              Column.And. 
             This aggregate object contains information about how to add a new variable
             to all of the modeling objects represented by its parts. If the new
             variable is to be installed in only one modeling object, there is no need
             to use the method 
             
              Column.And. 
             </p>
             <p>
             The column object constructed this way is now ready to be
             used to create a new variable. This is done by passing the
             column object as an argument to the constructor methods for
             variables, for example 
             
              IMPModeler.NumVar or IMPModeler.IntVar. 
             The newly created variable will
             immediately be part of the existing modeling objects that have been used
             to construct the column object.</p>

              IMPModeler.ColumnArray 
             for details of these parameters.</p>
             <p>
             The column-array objects can then be linked to an

              <c>IConversion</c> objects allow you to locally change the type of
              one or more variables.
              </summary>
             <remarks>  <p>
              After you create a conversion object, you must explicitly add the object 
              to your model and extract the object 
              so that CPLEX takes it into account. To add the conversion object 
              to your model, use the appropriate overload of the method 
              
               <c>IModel.Add</c>. 
              </p>
              <p>
              When a variable is created, its type is determined to be one of
              <c>Int</c>, <c>Float</c>, or <c>Bool</c>.  The
              type of a variable can be queried with the method
              <c>INumVar.GetType()</c>. It cannot be changed throughout the
              lifetime of the variable.</p>
              <p>
              However, it is sometimes necessary to consider a model where, for example,
              some integer variables are relaxed to be continuous.  This is achieved
              using objects of type <c>IConversion</c>. By adding an
              <c>IConversion</c> object to a model, you can change the types of
              the variables represented in the <c>IConversion</c> object for
              that model only. When solving the model, the changed types are
              used instead of the original types of the variables. Method
              <c>INumVar.GetType()</c> still returns the original variable
              types.</p>
              <p>
              The type of a variable can be changed only once per model. An attempt
              to add more than one <c>IConversion</c> object to a model
              containing the same variable will cause an exception to be thrown.</p>
              <p>
              To change the type of a variable more than once, you must remove the
              existing <c>IConversion</c> object before adding a new
              <c>IConversion</c> object. Removing the conversion object for a
              variable from the model will
              re-instantiate the original type of variable within that model.</p>
              <p>
              For an example of conversion in use, see the sample 
              
               <c>AdMIPex6.cs</c>   
              distributed with the product.

              As a modeling object, an instance of <c>ILPMatrix</c> 
              allows you to treat a set of variables and 
              range constraints (instances of <c>IRange</c>) 
              as a matrix.
              </summary>
             <remarks>
              <p>Objects of this class represent a set of linear constraints
              of the form <c>L &lt;= A x &lt;= U</c>, where  <c>L</c>
              and <c>U</c> are vectors and <c>A</c> is a matrix.  
              This modeling object allows
              you to edit <c>A</c> directly as a sparse matrix.</p>
              <p>
              Every row of an instance of <c>ILPMatrix</c> 
              corresponds to an instance of
              <c>IRange</c> representing a linear constraint. Every column of
              this matrix is linked to
              an <c>INumVar</c> object. An <c>INumVar</c> object cannot
              be linked to more than one column of <c>A</c>. An
              <c>IRange</c> object cannot be linked to more than one row of an
              <c>ILPMatrix</c>. The rows of an LP matrix are referenced by
              integer values, called the row indices, ranging from <c>0</c> 
              (zero) to
              <c>getNrows-1</c>. Similarly, the columns of an LP matrix are
              referenced by integer values, called the column indices, ranging from
              <c>0</c> (zero) to <c>getNcols-1</c>. Nonzero values in the LP
              matrix correspond to linear coefficients in the range constraints
              corresponding to its rows. For example, a nonzero coefficient
              <c>A[i][j]</c> in row <c>i</c> and column <c>j</c> is
              equivalent to the linear coefficient for the variable corresponding to
              column <c>j</c> of the LP matrix in the expression of the range
              constraint corresponding to row <c>i</c> of the LP matrix.

              Create an instance of <c>ILPMatrix</c> by calling the method
              
               IMPModeler.AddLPMatrix. 
              These methods create an empty instance of 
              <c>ILPMatrix</c>, that is, an LP matrix with 
              0 (zero) rows and 0 (zero) columns. 
              Populate the LP matrix by using the 
              methods <c>addRow</c>, <c>addRows</c>,
              <c>addColumn</c>, and <c>addCols</c>.</p>
            
              <p>
              Although you can add multiple ranges (that is, instances of 
              <c>IRange</c>) and multiple variables (that is, instances of
              <c>INumVar</c>) to an instance of <c>ILPMatrix</c>,
              it still remains a single modeling object. Any objects of 
              <c>IRange</c>  or <c>INumVar</c> added to an instance
              of <c>ILPMatrix</c> that is subsequently added to an instance
              of <c>Cplex</c>  are <b>not</b> directly accessible through
              the methods of <c>Cplex</c>. For example, consider 
              <c>r1</c>, an instance of
              <c>IRange</c> added to an instance of <c>ILPMatrix</c>
              subsequently added to an instance of <c>Cplex</c>, and
              <c>r2</c>,  an instance of <c>IRange</c> added directly 
              to the instance of <c>Cplex</c>. The range <c>r1</c>
              differs from the range <c>r2</c>; <c>r1</c> cannot be 
              modified directly by the methods of <c>Cplex</c>; in contrast,
              you can use methods of <c>Cplex</c> to modify <c>r2</c>.

             <remarks>  <p>The piecewise linear function is evaluated at <c>expr</c> and is

              Semi-continuous variables.
              </summary>
             <remarks>  <p>Objects implementing this interface represent constrained semi-continuous
              modeling variables. Semi-continuous variables implement 
              the interface 
              
               INumVar 
              the superinterface of numeric variables. 
              In an instance of <c>INumVar</c>, lb or LB 
              denotes the lower bound of the variable, and ub or UB  
              denotes its upper bound. The upper bound need not be finite.
              In an instance of the derived interface 
              <c>ISemiContVar</c>, sclb or SCLB 
              denotes the semi-continuous lower bound. The semi-continuous
              lower bound must not be negative. An attempt to assign a negative
              value to sclb will raise an error.</p>
              <p>
              In formal terms, if lb &lt;= 0, then a semi-continuous variable 
              is a numeric variable with the feasible set of {0, [sclb, ub]}, 
              where 0 &lt; sclb &lt; ub; otherwise, for other values of lb, 
              the feasible set of a semi-continuous variable is the intersection 
              of the interval [lb, ub] with the set {0, [sclb, ub]}. The semi-continuous 
              lower bound sclb may differ from the lower bound of an 
              ordinary numeric variable in that the semi-continuous variable 
              is restricted to the semi-continuous region. 
              For example, the following conditions declare the bounds 
              of a semi-continuous variable and the corresponding feasible region,  
              where square brackets denote a closed interval (that is, an interval
              including its endpoint).
              </p>
              <ul>
              <li>This condition
              lb == ub &lt; sclb 
              defines this feasible region {0} if lb == ub == 0 or empty set if 
              lb == ub != 0.
              </li>
              <li>This condition
              lb &lt;= 0 &lt; sclb &lt; ub
              defines this feasible region  {0, [sclb, ub]}.
              </li>
              <li>This condition
              0 &lt; lb &lt; sclb &lt; ub 
              defines this feasible region  [sclb, ub].
              </li>
              <li>This condition
              0 &lt; sclb &lt; lb &lt; ub 
              defines this feasible region [lb, ub].
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              When numerical bounds are given to an integer variable (such as
              an instance of <c>IIntVar</c> or <c>INumVar</c> 
              with Type = Int) in the constructors or via a modifier 
              (such as <c>setUB</c>, <c>setLB</c>, <c>setBounds</c>), 
              they are inwardly rounded to an integer value. UB  is rounded down, 
              and LB is rounded up.</p><p>
              With <c>lb</c> as the lower bound,
              <c>ub</c> as the upper bound, and <c>sclb</c> as the
              semi-continuous lower bound of the variable, the 
              <em>feasible region</em> of a semi-continuous variable is defined
              like this:</p>
              <p>
              <c>{lb &lt;= x &lt;= ub: x &gt;= sclb || x == 0}</c>
              </p>
              <p>
              As <c>ISemiContVar</c> is an extension of <c>INumVar</c>,
              semi-continuous variables can appear wherever regular variables can 
              appear; that is, as variables in expressions, in constraints, and so forth.
              </p><p>
              Semi-continuous variables are created by the methods

              <summary>
              The callback base class.
              </summary>
             <remarks>  <p>This class defines the common interface available to all callback
              classes. A callback is an object with a method <c>main</c>
              implemented by the user. This method is called by the
              <c>Cplex</c> algorithm at
              specific points during the optimization.  For each of these points, 
              CPLEX provides a context or an
              extension of <c>Cplex.Callback</c>.  To implement and use 
              a particular callback, the user must observe the following steps:</p>
              <ul>
              <li> Select the callback class corresponding to the callback to be
                   implemented, and create an extension of that class.</li>
              <li> Implement the method <c>main</c> for this extension.  
                   When doing
                   so, you can use all of the methods defined in the callback class and
                   its base classes.</li>
              <li> If the default implementation of the method <c>clone</c> is not
                   adequate, and if the callback is to be used for 
                   parallel optimization,
                   this method also needs to be implemented by the user.
                   Recall that the
                   default <c>clone</c> method performs a shallow copy, so
                   typically a user implementation needs to perform a deep copy for
                   objects that should be local to threads or the user implementation 
                   must use the
                   <c>synchronize</c> keyword where synchronization is required.
                   </li>
              <li> Create an instance of the user-written callback class and pass it to
                   <c>Cplex</c> with the method <c>Cplex.Use</c>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The next time a solution method is executed
              on the <c>Cplex</c>
              object for which the callback has been set, the method
              <c>main</c> of the callback will be called each time
              the corresponding point in the optimization algorithm is reached,
              for example at each iteration.</p>
              <p>
              The methods of this class are protected to make sure they are
              used only to derive a user-written callback class or to
              implement the <c>main</c> method in it.</p>
            
             <p>
               This class serves two different purposes:
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   It is the base class for the legacy callbacks. A legacy
                   callback is implemented by inheritance from any of the 
                   descendants of this class and by the user implementation of 
                   the <c>main</c> method.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   It provides a namespace for the more generic callback that is
                   implemented by implementation of the <c>Function</c> interface
                   (more specifically the <c>Function.Invoke(Cplex.Callback.Context)</c>
                   method) and then using the <c>Context</c> passed into that function
                   to performs queries and actions.
                 </li>

             <p><c>Cplex</c> stores such models internally in the standard

             <pre>
                Minimize (or Maximize)   c'x + x'Qx
                subject to               L &lt;= Ax &lt;= U
                                 a_i'x + x'Q_i x &lt;= r_i, for i = 1, ..., q

             </pre>
             <p>Thus A is the matrix of linear constraint coefficients,
             and L and U are the vectors of lower and upper bounds on the
             vector of variables, x.  The Q matrix must
             be positive semi-definite (or negative semi-definite in the maximization
             case) and represents the quadratic terms of the objective function.
             The matrices Q_i must be positive semi-definite and represent the quadratic
             terms of the i-th quadratic constraint, and the a_i are vectors containing
             the corresponding linear terms.
             For more about the Q_i, see the chapter about QCP in
             the <em>CPLEX User's Manual</em>.</p>
             <p>
             If the model contains integer, Boolean, or semi-continuous variables,
             or if the model has special ordered sets (SOSs), the model is referred to
             as a <em>mixed integer program</em> (MIP). You can query whether the
             active model is a MIP with the method
             <c>Cplex.IsMIP</c>.
             </p><p>
             A model with quadratic terms in the objective is referred to as
             a <em>mixed integer quadratic program</em> (MIQP) if it is also a MIP,
             and a <em>quadratic program</em> (QP) otherwise.
             You can query whether the active model has a quadratic objective
             by calling method
             <c>Cplex.IsQO</c>.
             </p>
             <p>
             A model with quadratic constraints is referred to as a <em>quadratically
             constrained program</em> (MIQCP) if it is also a MIP, and as QCP otherwise.
             You can query whether the active model is
             quadratically constrained by calling the method
             <c>Cplex.IsQC</c>.
             A QCP may or may not have a quadratic objective; that is, a given problem
             may be both QP and QCP.  Likewise, a MIQCP may
             or may not have a quadratic objective; that is, a given problem may be
             both MIQP and MIQCP.
             </p>
             <p>
             If there are no quadratic terms in the objective, no integer constraints,
             and the problem is not quadratically constrained, it is called a
             <em>linear program</em> (LP).
             </p>
             <p>If there are no quadratic terms in the objective,
             and the problem is not quadratically constrained, but there are integer
             variables, it is called a <em>mixed integer linear program</em> (MILP).
             </p>
             <p>Special ordered sets (SOS)
             fall outside the conventional representation in terms of A and Q matrices
             and are stored separately.</p>

             <p>Additional information about the active model can be obtained through

             <p>
             <c>Cplex</c> effectively treats all models as MIQCP models.
             That is, it allows the most general case, although the solution algorithms
             make efficient use of special cases, such as the absence of quadratic
             terms in the formulation.</p>
             <p>
             The method
             <c>Cplex.Solve</c>
             is used to solve the
             active model.  It begins by solving the <em>root relaxation</em> of the
             MIQCP model, where all integrality constraints and SOSs are ignored.  If
             the model has no integrality constraints or SOSs, then the optimization
             is complete once the root relaxation is solved.  Otherwise,
             <c>Cplex</c> uses a branch and cut procedure to reintroduce
             the integrality constraints and SOS constraints.  See the
             <em>CPLEX User's Manual</em> for more information
             about branch and cut.</p>
             <p>
             Most users can simply call the method
             <c>Cplex.Solve</c>
             to solve their models.
             However, several parameters are available for users who require more
             control.
             Perhaps the most important one is 
             <c>Cplex.IntParam.RootAlg</c>, 
             which determines the algorithm used to solve the root relaxation.
             Possible settings, as defined in 
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm</c> 
             are:</p>
             <ul>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Auto</c> 
                 <c>Cplex</c> automatically selects an algorithm. This is the
                 default setting.</li>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Primal</c> 
                 Use the primal simplex algorithm.</li>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Dual</c> 
                 Use the dual simplex algorithm.</li>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Network</c> 
                 Use network simplex on the embedded network part of the model,
                 followed by dual simplex on the entire model.</li>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Barrier</c> 
                 Use the barrier algorithm.</li>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Sifting</c> 
                 Use the sifting algorithm. This option is not available for quadratic
                 problems. If selected nonetheless, <c>Cplex</c> defaults to
                 the <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Auto</c> setting.</li>
             <li>
             <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Concurrent</c> 
                 Use several algorithms concurrently. This option is not available
                 for quadratic problems. If selected nonetheless, <c>Cplex</c>
                 defaults to the <c>Cplex.Algorithm.Auto</c> setting.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Numerous other parameters allow you to control algorithmic aspects of
             the optimizer.  See
             <c>Cplex.IntParam</c>,
             <c>Cplex.LongParam</c>,
             <c>Cplex.DoubleParam</c>,
             <c>Cplex.BooleanParam</c>, and
             <c>Cplex.StringParam</c>
             for further information.
             Parameters are set with the method
             <c>setParam</c>.
             </p><p>
             Even higher levels of control can be achieved through the use of goals
             (see
             <c>Cplex.Goal</c>)
             or callbacks (see
             <c>Cplex.Callback</c>
             and its extensions).</p>
             <p>
             The 
             <c>Cplex.Solve</c>
             method returns a Boolean value reporting whether
             (<c>true</c>) or not
             (<c>false</c>) a solution (not necessarily the optimal one) has been
             found. Further information about the solution can be queried with the method
             <c>getStatus</c>.  The return code of type
             <c>Cplex.Status</c> reports whether the
             solution is feasible, bounded, or optimal,
             or whether the model has been proven
             to be infeasible or unbounded.  See
             <c>Cplex.Status</c>
             for more information.</p>
             <p>
             The method
             <c>Cplex.GetCplexStatus</c>
             provides more detailed information about the status of the optimizer after
             <c>Cplex.Solve</c>
             returns. For example, it can provide
             information about why the optimizer terminated prematurely (time limit,
             iteration limit, or other limits).  The methods
             <c>Cplex.IsPrimalFeasible</c>
             and
             <c>Cplex.IsDualFeasible</c>
             determine whether a primal or dual feasible solution has been found
             and can be queried.</p>
             <p>
             The most important solution information computed by <c>Cplex</c>
             are usually the solution vector and the objective function value.
             The method
             <c>Cplex.GetValue</c>
             queries the solution vector and
             <c>Cplex.GetObjValue</c>
             queries the value of the objective function.
             Most optimizers also compute additional solution information.
             (for example, dual values, reduced costs, simplex bases, etc.)  This
             additional information can also be queried through various methods of
             <c>Cplex</c>.  If you attempt to retrieve solution information
             that is not available from a particular optimizer, <c>Cplex</c>
             will throw an exception.</p>
             <p>
             If you are solving an LP and a basis is available, the solution can be
             further analyzed by performing sensitivity analysis. This information tells  *  you how sensitive the solution is with respect to changes in
             variable bounds, constraint bounds, or objective coefficients.
             The information is computed and accessed with the methods
             <c>Cplex.GetBoundSA</c>,
             <c>Cplex.GetRangeSA</c>,
             <c>Cplex.GetRHSSA</c>, and
             <c>Cplex.GetObjSA</c>.
             </p>
             <p>
             An important consideration when you access solution information is the
             numeric quality of the solution.
             Since <c>Cplex</c> performs arithmetic operations using
             finite precision, solutions are always subject to numeric errors.
             For most problems, numeric errors are well within reasonable tolerances.
             However, for numerically difficult models, you
             are advised to verify the quality of the solution using the method
             <c>Cplex.GetQuality</c>,
             which offers a variety of quality measures.</p></remarks>

             <remarks> <p><b>Important:</b></p>
             <p>
             Advanced methods typically demand a profound understanding
             of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
             incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
             to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
             you can accomplish the same task by means of other methods instead.
             </p>
              <p>
              This method adds <c>cut</c> as a user cut to the
              invoking <c>Cplex</c>
              object. Unlike regular constraints that are added to the model, user
              cuts are by default left out of the optimization until they are violated.
              It is only after a node solution violates a user cut that the cut is added
              to the relaxation and will be used from then on.  Unlike lazy
              constraints, user cuts must not reduce the feasible region of the
              problem; they can only strengthen the relaxation; otherwise,
              incorrect solutions can result.</p>
              <p>
              When columns are deleted from the active model, all user cuts are
              deleted as well and need to be added again if they should be considered.
              Use <c>clearUserCuts</c> to remove all user cuts from
              the invoking <c>Cplex</c> object.</p>
              <p>

              <p>On successful completion, the

              minimum-cost relaxation.
              This solution can be queried with conventional query methods, such as

              <p>The method <c>feasOpt</c> provides several different
              metrics for determining what constitutes a minimum-cost relaxation.
              The metric is specified by the parameter <c>FeasOptMode</c>.
              The <c>feasOpt</c> method can also optionally perform a second
              optimization phase where the original objective is optimized,
              subject to the constraint that the associated relaxation must
              have the same cost as the minimum-cost relaxation computed in the first

              reciprocal of the preference value to weight the
              relaxations of the associated bounds in the phase one cost function.
              A negative or 0 (zero) value specifies that the corresponding bound must

             application nor limited by a user-specified restriction of time or
             other resources), then the conflict can be accessed by means of the
             method <c>getConflict</c> as a minimal set of
             constraints that are still infeasible.  Removal of any of these constraints
             will remove that particular cause for infeasibility.  However, if
             other infeasible sets still exist in the model, then that removal
             from the model of any of the constraints in the returned set
             does <b>not</b> guarantee feasibility of the remaining model.</p>
            
             <p>Constraints can be considered in groups
             organized by <c>IAnd</c> constructed with 
              <c>IMPModeler.And</c>.
             If any constraint in a group
             participates in the conflict, the entire group is determined to do so.
             No further detail about the constraints within that group is returned.</p>
            
             <p>A group or constraint may be assigned a preference.  A constraint with a
             higher preference is more likely to be included in the conflict.  However,
             no guarantee is made when a conflict is returned that other infeasible
             sets containing groups or constraints with a higher preference
             may exist.</p>
            
             <p>To check whether the bounds of a variable cause a conflict, use
             instances of the class <c>ILOG.Concert.INumVarBound</c>
             to specify the upper and lower bounds of the variable in question.
             Use those bounds like constraints among the arguments you pass to

              <c>Cplex</c> will not blindly accept such a solution.  Instead,
              it will make sure that this solution is compatible with both the
              model and the goals.  When checking feasibility with goals, it will
              check feasibility with
              both goals that have already been executed and goals that are still on the
              goal stack.  Thus, in particular, <c>Cplex</c> will reject any
              solution that is not compatible with the branching that has been done so
              far. It then continues by checking compatibility with the goals still
              remaining on the goal stack, including those goals that are created 
              by them.
              Only if the proposed solution remains feasible and has a better objective
              value than the current incumbent will it be used to replace the current

             Generates multiple solutions to a mixed integer programming (MIP) model.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             <p>In other words, the method <c>populate</c>
             populates the solution pool of the model currently extracted by
             the invoking <c>Cplex</c> object. Like the method
             <c>solve</c>, this method returns true
             if it finds a solution (not necessarily an optimal solution).</p>
            
             <p>The algorithm that populates the solution pool works in two phases:</p>
            
             <p><strong>In the first phase</strong>, it solves the model to
             optimality (or some stopping criterion set by the user) while it
             sets up a branch and cut tree for the second phase.</p>
            
             <p><strong>In the second phase</strong>, it generates multiple solutions
             by using the information computed and stored in the first phase
             and by continuing to explore the tree.</p>
            
             <p>The amount of preparation in the first phase and the intensity
             of exploration in the second phase are controlled by the solution
             pool intensity parameter <c>SolnPoolIntensity</c>.</p>
            
             <p>Optimality is not a stopping criterion for the
             <c>populate</c> method.
             Even if the optimality gap is zero, this method will still try
             to find alternative solutions. The <strong>stopping criteria</strong>
             for <c>populate</c> are these:</p>
             <ul>
             <li>Pool limit <c>SolnPoolLim</c>. This parameter
             controls how many solutions are generated before stopping. Its default
             value is 20.
             </li>
             <li>Time limit <c>TiLim</c>, as in standard MIP optimization.
             </li>
             <li>Deterministic time limit <c>DetTiLim</c>, as in standard MIP optimization.
             </li>
             <li>Node limit <c>NodeLim</c>, as in standard MIP optimization.
             </li>
             <li>In the absence of other stopping criteria, <c>populate</c>
             stops when it cannot enumerate any more solutions. In particular, if the
             user specifies an objective tolerance with the relative or absolute
             solution pool gap parameters, <c>populate</c> stops if it
             cannot enumerate any more solutions within the specified objective
             tolerance. There may exist additional solutions that satisfy the
             specified objective tolerance; depending on the solution pool intensity
             parameter, <c>populate</c> may or may not enumerate all of them;
             according to certain settings of the solution pool intensity parameter,
             <c>populate</c> may stop when it has enumerated a subset of
             additional solutions satisfying the specified objective tolerance.
             </li>
             </ul>
            
             <p>Successive calls to <c>populate</c> create solutions
             that are stored in the solution pool. However, each call to
             <c>populate</c> applies only to the subset of solutions
             created in the current call; the call does not affect the solutions
             already in the pool. In other words, solutions in the pool are
             persistent. </p>
            
             <p>The user may call this routine independently of any MIP optimization
              of a model. In that case, it carries
             out the first and second phase itself. </p>
            
             <p>The user may also call <c>populate</c> after
             standard MIP optimization.
             In the general case, the user reads the model,
             calls MIP optimization, then calls <c>populate</c>. The
             activity of MIP optimization constitutes the first phase of the
             populate algorithm; <c>populate</c> then re-uses the
             information computed and stored by MIP optimization and thus
             carries out only the second phase.</p>
            
             <p>The method <c>populate</c> does not try to generate
             multiple solutions for unbounded MIP models. As soon
             as the proof of unboundedness is obtained,
             <c>populate</c> stops.</p></remarks>

            <remarks>  <p>If the delete mode is set to

             will remain unchanged if variables or constraints are removed from the

             <p>

            <remarks>  <p>If the delete mode is set to

             when variables or constraints are removed. This situation
             makes the delete
             operation more computation intensive, but it may provide a better
             starting point for reoptimization after the modification of the active

             <p>The method <c>feasOpt</c> works in two phases. In its first phase,

             a value with <c>Min</c> in its symbolic name.  If you want

             solution that is optimal with respect to
             the original objective function, subject

             <p>In both phases, the suffixes <c>Sum</c>, <c>Inf</c>, and

             <ul>
             <li><c>Sum</c>
             tells <c>feasOpt</c> to minimize the weighted sum of
             the required relaxations of bounds and constraints.
             </li>
             <li><c>Inf</c>
             tells <c>feasOpt</c> to minimize the number
             of bounds and constraints that are relaxed.
             </li>
             <li><c>Quad</c>
             tells <c>feasOpt</c> to minimize the weighted sum of
             the squares of required relaxations of bounds and constraints.
             </li>
             </ul>
             <p>Weights are determined by the preference values provided
             as input to the method <c>feasOpt</c>.</p>
            
             <p>When the method <c>and</c> is used to group constraints
             as input to
             <c>feasOpt</c>, the relaxation is computed on groups instead
             of on individual constraints.  For example, all constraints in a
             group can be relaxed for a total cost of one unit under the various
             <c>Inf</c> metrics.</p></remarks>

               <summary>
               This class contains symbolic names to identify measures of the quality 
               of a solution.
               </summary>
            <remarks>These measures can be queried from the method 
               <c>Cplex.GetQuality</c>.
               These solution quality measures pertain either to 
               <b>characteristics</b> of the computed solution or to the 
               <b>accuracy measures</b> of the computed solution. 
               When the name of the solution quality measure begins with 
               <i>Max</i>, that measure identifies a constraint or a variable associated 
               with the requested solution quality measure.  For example, if you pass 
               the solution quality measure <c>MaxPi</c> to the method 
               <c>Cplex.GetQuality</c>, the result is an instance of 
               <c>IRange</c> with the largest dual value (that is, a 
               characteristic of the solution) among the constraints in the model 
               specified by the <c>Cplex</c> object. Similarly, the solution 
               quality measure <c>MaxIntInfeas</c> causes the method 
               <c>Cplex.GetQuality</c> to return an instance of 
               <c>INumVar</c> with the largest integrality violation 
               (that is, a measure of accuracy) in the computed solution.  
                For these solution quality measures, the variable or
                range returned is the first variable or range that attains the
                maximal associated quality value.

             <remarks>  <p>The possible quality
              measures are declared in <c>Cplex.QualityType</c>.  A quality
              object is returned by the method <c>Cplex.GetQuality</c>.  The
              returned quality object contains its type and the numeric value

              value is attained at a specific constraint or variable.  In such cases,
              the relevant constraint or variable is contained in the quality
              object as well, unless the constraint has been implicitly created
              as a result of automatic linearization.
              Methods are provided to query all information stored in a quality object.

              The callback base class.

             <remarks>  <p>This class defines the common interface available to all callback
              classes. A callback is an object with a method <c>main</c>
              implemented by the user. This method is called by the
              <c>Cplex</c> algorithm at
              specific points during the optimization.  For each of these points, 
              CPLEX provides a context or an
              extension of <c>Cplex.Callback</c>.  To implement and use 
              a particular callback, the user must observe the following steps:</p>
              <ul>
              <li> Select the callback class corresponding to the callback to be
                   implemented, and create an extension of that class.</li>
              <li> Implement the method <c>main</c> for this extension.  
                   When doing
                   so, you can use all of the methods defined in the callback class and

              <li> If the default implementation of the method <c>clone</c> is not
                   adequate, and if the callback is to be used for 
                   parallel optimization,
                   this method also needs to be implemented by the user.
                   Recall that the
                   default <c>clone</c> method performs a shallow copy, so
                   typically a user implementation needs to perform a deep copy for
                   objects that should be local to threads or the user implementation 
                   must use the
                   <c>synchronize</c> keyword where synchronization is required.

              <p>The next time a solution method is executed
              on the <c>Cplex</c>
              object for which the callback has been set, the method
              <c>main</c> of the callback will be called each time
              the corresponding point in the optimization algorithm is reached,
              for example at each iteration.</p>

              The methods of this class are protected to make sure they are
              used only to derive a user-written callback class or to

               This class serves two different purposes:
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   It is the base class for the legacy callbacks. A legacy
                   callback is implemented by inheritance from any of the 
                   descendants of this class and by the user implementation of 
                   the <c>main</c> method.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   It provides a namespace for the more generic callback that is
                   implemented by implementation of the <c>Function</c> interface
                   (more specifically the <c>Function.Invoke(Cplex.Callback.Context)</c>
                   method) and then using the <c>Context</c> passed into that function
                   to performs queries and actions.
                 </li>
               </ul>

             Instructs CPLEX to stop the current optimization after the
             user-written callback finishes.
             </summary>
            <remarks>  <p>
             This method can be called from a user-written implementation of a
             <c>main</c> method to instruct the invoking  CPLEX
             optimizer to stop the current optimization.
             </p>
             <p>
             After an invocation of this method, it is possible to resume 
             optimization by another invocation of the method <c>solve</c>.
             In such a case, optimization continues at the node of the search tree 
             where the <c>abort</c> method was called. In fact, any time 
             that <c>solve</c> stops for a reason other than an error, you 
             can resume optimization by re-invoking <c>solve</c>.
             </p>
             <p>
             In contrast, executing additional callback methods in the callback can
             lead to unpredictable behavior. For example, callback methods such
             as <c>Cplex.SolveCallback.Solve</c> or
             <c>Cplex.BranchCallback.MakeBranch</c>
             can overwrite the callback status and thus enable the optimization
             to continue.  Therefore, to abort an optimization effectively,
             a user should exit the callback by one of
             the following ways:
             </p>
             <ul>
             <li>Call <c>return</c> immediately after the call
             of <c>abort</c>. </li>
             <li>Structure the callback so that it calls no additional methods
             of <c>Cplex.Callback</c> and its subclasses after
             <c>abort</c>.</li>

             Places in which a CPLEX callback can be invoked.
             </summary>
             <remarks> <p>The values defined here specify in which contexts CPLEX can invoke a
             callback. They are used in two different ways:
             <ul>
               <li>The are used as arguments to
                   <c>Callback.Function.Invoke</c> to indicate in which
                   context the callback has just been invoked.</li>
               <li>A bit-wise OR of these values is used as argument to
                   <c>Cplex.Use(Callback.Function, long)</c> to specify  in which places
                   CPLEX should invoke the registered callback.</li>
             </ul> </p>
             <p>For details about the various context values, 
             refer to <i>Callback context</i> in 
             the <i>Reference Manual of the Callable Library (C API)</i>
             for further details about these values.
             reference documentation.</p>
            
             <p>Important notes about the <c>ThreadDown</c> context:</p>
             <ul>
               <li>If a callback invoked in <c>ThreadUp</c> context throws an
                   exception then <c>ThreadDown</c> will <b>not</b> be invoked
                   on this thread!</li>
               <li>The callback function is not allowed to throw exceptions if invoked
                   in context <c>ThreadDown</c>. Any exception thrown in this
                   context will be ignored.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>You may think of <c>ThreadUp</c> and <c>ThreadDown</c> as
             "constructor" and "destructor": the destructor is only invoked if the

             <remarks>  <p>An instance of the class <c>MIPCallback</c> represents a

              <c>Cplex</c>
              to solve a mixed integer program (MIP).
              <c>Cplex</c>
              calls the user-written callback prior to solving
              each node in the branch-and-cut search. This class allows you to
              access an incumbent solution, an incumbent node, and an incumbent
              objective value from a user-written callback. It also allows you to
              access priority orders and statistical information, such as the number
              of cuts that have been generated. Methods are also available to query
              the number of generated cuts for each type of cut CPLEX generates.
              See the <em>CPLEX User's Manual</em> for more information about
              cuts.</p>

              <summary>
              Class of callbacks called when a new incumbent is found.
              </summary>
             <remarks>  <p>This is an advanced class.</p>
              <p><b>Important:</b></p>
              <p>
              Advanced classes typically demand a profound understanding
              of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
              incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
              to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
              you can accomplish the same task by means of other classes instead.
              </p>
              <p>An instance of
              this callback class is called whenever a new potential incumbent is found
              during the branch-and-cut search. It allows you to analyze the proposed
              incumbent and optionally reject it. In this case, CPLEX
              will continue the branch-and-cut search.  However, since CPLEX considers
              the current node solution to be integer feasible, it will not be able to
              determine a reasonable way to branch.  Thus, when this callback is
              implemented in such a way that it may reject an incumbent, it is
              typically paired with a branch callback to perform the branching after an
              incumbent has been rejected. </p>
            
             <p>When you use this callback to reject an incumbent, you must set 
             the parameter to control the type of primal and dual reductions,
             <c>Cplex.IntParam.Reduce</c>
             either to 1 (one) in order to restrict presolve to
             primal reductions only, or to 0 (zero) in order to disable all
             presolve reductions.  This setting of the reduction parameter is not
             necessary if the incumbent callback is used for other purposes.

               this point no search tree is setup yet and there are no search tree
               nodes yet.
               Consequently, a lot of the callback functions that require a node context
               will fail in this situation.

             unbounded direction. The vector is scaled in such a way that the
             maximum absolute value of one of its elements is
             <c>CPX_INFBOUND</c>.  Thus, often the vector
             can be used directly, for example to separate lazy constraints.  However,
             due to the large values, care must be taken to deal with potential
             numerical errors.  If in doubt, rescale the vector, and use it as an
             unbounded ray rather than as a primal vector.</p>

              Callback class for lazy constraints.
              </summary>
             <remarks>  <p>This is an advanced class.</p>
              <p><b>Important:</b></p>
              <p>
              Advanced classes typically demand a profound understanding
              of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
              incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
              to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
              you can accomplish the same task by means of other classes instead.
              </p>
              <p>This is the lazy constraint callback class.
              Extensions of this class implement user-written lazy constraint
              callbacks.  These allow you to add lazy constraints to the problem while
              the problem is being solved with branch-and-cut search.  These lazy
              constraints may contribute to the model formulation and restrict the
              feasible region of the problem.  By contrast, if a constraint to be added
              during branch-and-cut search does not change the feasible region of the
              active model but only strengthens the formulation, it is referred to
              as a <em>user cut</em>.  Such constraints should better be added through
              <c>Cplex.UserCutCallback</c> because this distinction allows
              <c>Cplex</c> potentially
              to perform more presolve reductions.  It is an error,
              however, to add lazy constraints by means of a user cut callback.</p>
              <p>
              The idea behind lazy constraints is that the LPs that are solved when
              the MIP is being solved can be kept smaller when these constraints are not
              included.  <c>Cplex</c> will, however, include a lazy constraint
              in the LP as soon as it becomes violated. In other words, the solution
              computed by <c>Cplex</c> makes sure
              that all the lazy constraints that have been added are satisfied.</p>
              <p>
              If you use <c>LazyConstraintCallback</c>, you are free to add
              cuts that may chop off solutions that are otherwise feasible with
              respect to the model, in contrast to <c>UserCutCallback</c>.
              In the case of <c>UserCutCallback</c>, you effectively promise
              CPLEX that you are not adding cuts that reduce the solution space by
              the callback.</p>
              <p>
              When you query information about the current solution to be tested, such
              information may be different from information directly derived from the
              node relaxation.  Such differences arise when the solution candidate to be
              tested is generated from a heuristic rather than the branch-and-bound tree
              itself.</p>
            
             <p><b>Important:</b></p>
             <p>The lazy constraint callback may be invoked during MIP start processing.
              In that case, 
              {@link Cplex.LazyConstraintCallback#getSolutionSource() 
                     Cplex.LazyConstraintCallback.GetSolutionSource()} 
              returns <c>MIPStartSolution</c>. When this value is returned, 
              some special considerations apply:
              <ul>
              <li>MIP start processing occurs very early in the solution process. At
               this point no search tree is setup yet and there are no search tree
               nodes yet. Consequently, a lot of the callback functions that require a
               node context will fail in this situation.
              </li>
              <li>Lazy constraints separated when processing a MIP start will be
               discarded after that MIP start has been processed. This means that the
               callback may have to separate the same constraint again for the next MIP
               start or for a solution that is found later in the solution process.
              </li>
              </ul>

              (that is, eliminate) the lazy constraint under certain circumstances 
              (for example, if the constraint becomes slack). Consequently, 
              in view of such purging, the user must not assume that any 
              previously added constraints are still in the current relaxation. 
              In other words, the purged constraint may be violated in subsequent 
              relaxations, and the user must take responsibility to check whether 
              any new incumbent solution requires that the purged lazy constraint

             <remarks>

              <p><b>Important:</b></p>
              <p>
              Advanced classes typically demand a profound understanding
              of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
              incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
              to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
              you can accomplish the same task by means of other classes instead.
              </p>
              <p>
              This is the base class for user-written callbacks that allow the user to
              select the node to process next during the branch-and-cut search.
              Node callbacks allow you to determine which node from among the
              unexplored nodes <c>Cplex</c> will chose to explore next in the
              branch-and-cut search.  They also give you the option to override this
              selection. </p>
              <p>
              When an instance of this callback class executes, the invoking instance of
              <c>Cplex</c> still has <c>n = getNremainingNodes</c>
              (inherited from <c>MIPCallback</c>) nodes left to process. These
              remaining nodes are numbered from <c>0</c> (zero) to
              <c>n-1</c>. For that reason, the same node may have a different
              number each time an instance of <c>NodeCallback</c> is called. To
              identify a node uniquely, an instance of <c>Cplex</c> also
              assigns a unique identifier
              (<c>Cplex.NodeId</c>) to each node. That unique
              identifier remains unchanged throughout the search. The method
              <c>Cplex.ControlCallback.GetNodeId()</c> 
              allows you to access the
              <c>Cplex.NodeId</c> for each of the remaining
              nodes <c>0</c>
              to <c>n-1</c>. Similarly, the method 
              <c>Cplex.NodeCallback.GetNodeNumber(Cplex.NodeId)</c>
              returns the number of a node specified by its
              <c>Cplex.NodeId</c>.</p>

              <summary>
              Base class for user-written callbacks that control branching.
              </summary>
             <remarks>
              <p>This is an advanced class.</p>
              <p><b>Important:</b></p>
              <p>
              Advanced classes typically demand a profound understanding
              of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
              incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
              to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
              you can accomplish the same task by means of other classes instead.
              </p>
              <p>This is the base class for user-written callbacks that
              control branching during the branch-and-cut search.
              This callback will be called prior to the creation of the children
              of the current node.
              It allows you to query how the invoking instance of
              <c>Cplex</c>
              is about to create the children,
              and gives you the opportunity to override creation of this branch.</p>
              <p>
              You can create one or two branches by calling one of the
              <c>makeBranch</c> methods once or twice. It is an error to call
              that method more than twice.</p>
              <p>
              By calling method <c>prune</c>, you remove the current node from
              the search tree. In other words, no subnodes from the current node will
              be added to the search tree. Calling both <c>prune</c> and
              <c>makeBranch</c> in one invocation of a branch callback is an
              error and yields unspecified behavior.</p>
              <p>
              If you call neither <c>prune</c> nor <c>makeBranch</c>,
              the instance of <c>Cplex</c> proceeds with its own
              branching.</p>
              <p>
              The constructor and methods of this class are protected to make sure that
              they are used only to derive a user-written callback class or to
              implement the <c>main</c> method in it.</p>
            
             <p>The user must be careful when using this class. 
             Pruning a valid node can <b>prune the optimal solution</b>. 
             Also, choosing a different branching variable can result in placing an 
             <b>invalid bound</b> on a variable. </p>
             
             <p>In particular, the user must not branch on variables 
             that are <b>implied feasible</b>, as defined in 
             <c>Cplex.IntegerFeasibilityStatus</c>.
             <i>Implied feasible</i> means that the variable has been presolved out.
             It will be feasible when all other integer variables are feasible. 
             Branching on such variables can cut off feasible solutions.</p>
             
             <p>If the user intends to branch on <b>continuous</b> variables, 
             the user must disable dual presolve reductions. To disable 
             dual presolve reductions, set the parameter 
             to control primal and dual reduction type,  
             <c>Cplex.Param.Preprocessing.Reduce</c>,  
             either to the value 1 (one) (that is, CPX_PREREDUCE_PRIMALONLY)
             or to the value 0 (zero) (that is, CPX_PREREDUCE_NOPRIMALORDUAL). </p>
             
             <p>Also, if the user intends to branch on 
             <b>continuous</b> variables, 
             the user must turn off the linear reduction switch, 
             <c>Cplex.Param.Preprocessing.Linear</c>. </p>
            
             <p>By design, the CPLEX branch callback calculates 
             and provides the branching decisions that CPLEX would make 
             in case the user does not create any branches in the callback. 
             Depending on variable selection and other features of your model, 
             the computation of these candidate branches can be time-consuming. 
             Consequently, if you know that you will never use the 
             branching candidates suggested by CPLEX, then you can save time 
             by disabling such features as strong branching. </p>

              Base class for user-written callbacks injecting integer-feasible
              solutions during search.
              </summary>
             <remarks>

              <p><b>Important:</b></p>
              <p>
              Advanced classes typically demand a profound understanding
              of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
              incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
              to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
              you can accomplish the same task by means of other classes instead.
              </p><p>
              This is the base class for user-written callbacks allowing you to inject
              integer-feasible solutions during the branch-and-cut search.
              During branching, the heuristic callback is called after
              each node subproblem has been solved, including any cuts that
              may have been newly generated.  Before branching, at the root node,
              the heuristic callback is also called before each round of cuts is
              added to the problem and re-solved.
              </p>
              <p>This callback class also provides support for
              implementing simplex-based heuristics for constructing solutions, by
              allowing you to change the bounds of variables and re-solve the node
              relaxation.  Changing the bounds in the heuristic callback has no
              effect on the search after the callback has completed.
              This callback will be called after the node relaxation
              (including all cuts generated at that node) has been solved.</p>

            Base class of user-written implementation classes of goals.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p>This is an advanced class.</p>
            <p><b>Important:</b></p>
            <p>
            Advanced classes typically demand a profound understanding
            of the algorithms used by CPLEX. Thus they incur a higher risk of
            incorrect behavior in your application, behavior that can be difficult
            to debug. Therefore, the team encourages you to consider carefully whether
            you can accomplish the same task by means of other classes instead.
            </p>
            <p>Goals can be used to control the branch-and-cut search in
            <c>Cplex</c>.  In some respects, goals are an alternative
            to callbacks for controlling branch-and-cut search.
            Goals are implemented in subclasses of class
            <c>Cplex.Goal</c>.  Thus, this is the base class for
            user-written implementation classes of CPLEX goals.
            To implement your own goal, you need to create a subclass of
            <c>Cplex.Goal</c> and implement its pure virtual method
            <c>execute</c>.  After implementing your goal class, you use it
            by calling the method <c>Cplex.Solve(goal)</c> instead of
            the standard <c>Cplex.Solve</c> without an argument.</p>
            <p>
            The <c>execute</c> method is called by <c>Cplex</c>
            at each branch-and-cut node (referred to as the current node) after the
            node relaxation has been solved.
            Every node maintains a stack of goals, and the top goal from this
            stack is popped and executed until the stack becomes empty or some
            special goal is encountered as described below.  When the goal stack of
            a node becomes empty, CPLEX continues with its built-in search for that
            subtree.  When <c>Cplex.Solve(goal)</c> is called,
             <c>goal</c> is simply pushed on the goal stack of the root node
             before the branch-and-cut search begins.</p>
             <p>
             The method <c>Cplex.Goal.Execute</c> is where you
             can control the branch-and-cut search of <c>Cplex</c>.  Class
             <c>Cplex.Goal</c> provides several methods for querying
             information about the current node. It is, however, the goal returned
             by the <c>execute</c> method that determines how to proceed with
             the search.  CPLEX provides several methods that create
             special goals that can be used to define the ongoing search in addition
             to any user-written goal:</p>
             <ul>
             <li> <c>Cplex.Or</c> creates a goal that will create child
                  nodes when executed.  One child will be created for every
                  argument passed to the method <c>Cplex.Or</c>.  Each
                  child node will be initialized with a copy of the goal stack of
                  the current node.  Goals provided to the method
                  <c>Cplex.Or</c> as arguments are then
                  pushed onto the goal stack of the
                  corresponding child.  Finally, the current node will be
                  deleted and a new node will be picked from the tree for evaluation.
                  </li>
             <li> Constraint goals are created with, for example, the method
                  <c>Cplex.ConstraintGoal</c> with a constraint as its
                  argument as a local cut.  When executed, the constraint will be
                  added to the node problem for all nodes in that subtree.  It will
                  not, however, be added to nodes outside the subtree; use the method
                  <c>Cplex.GlobalCutGoal</c> for doing this.
                  Other methods for creating
                  constraint goals more conveniently are <c>Cplex.LeGoal</c>,
                  <c>Cplex.GeGoal</c>, and <c>Cplex.EqGoal</c>.</li>
             <li> As we just discussed, global cut goals are created with the method
                  <c>Cplex.GlobalCutGoal</c>.  When executed, they add a
                  global cut to the model being solved.</li>
             <li> The method <c>Cplex.And</c> takes several goals as
                  arguments.
                  When executed, it simply pushes these goals on the goal stack in
                  reverse order so that they will be executed in the order they have
                  been provided as arguments.</li>
             <li> The method <c>Cplex.SolutionGoal</c> returns a goal that
                  attempts to inject a solution into the branch-and-cut search.</li>
             <li> Executing the goal returned by the method
                  <c>Cplex.BranchAsCplex</c> will cause CPLEX to
                  continue with its own branching decision.  This is different from
                  continuing with an empty goal stack in that goals can still be
                  executed at every node, thus maintaining the possibility of
                  taking control at any time.</li>
             <li> When the goal created with the method <c>Cplex.FailGoal</c>
                  is executed, the current node will be pruned.  That is, the search
                  will be discontinued below the current node.  If available, one of
                  the remaining nodes from the branch-and-cut tree will be chosen for
                  evaluation.</li>
             <li> When executing any other goal, the returned goal is simply pushed on
                  the goal stack, unless the returned goal is <c>null</c>, which
                  will simply be ignored.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Goals returned by <c>Cplex.Or</c> and
             <c>Cplex.And</c> allow you to combine goals.
             <c>Cplex.And</c> allows you to execute different goals at
             one node, while <c>Cplex.Or</c> allows you to execute
             different goals on different newly, created nodes.  A typical use of
             these two goals in a return statement of a user written goal is:</p>
             <p>
                <c>return cplex.And ( cplex.Or (branch1, branch2), this);</c>
              </p><p>
              The <c>Cplex.And</c> goal first pushes <c>this</c>,
              that is, the goal currently being executed, on the goal stack and then it
              pushes the <c>Cplex.Or</c> goal.  Thus the
              <c>Cplex.Or</c> goal is on top of the stack and will be
              executed next.  When the <c>Cplex.Or</c> is executed, it
              creates two new nodes and copies the remaining goal stack to both of
              them.  Thus both new nodes will have <c>this</c>
              goal on top of the goal
              stack at this point.  Then the <c>Cplex.Or</c> proceeds to
              push <c>branch1</c> on the goal stack of the first child node and
              <c>branch2</c> on the goal stack of the second goal child node.
              Typically, <c>branch1</c> and <c>branch2</c> would
              eventually contain constraint goals so by executing <c>branch1</c>
              and <c>branch2</c> at the respective child nodes, the child nodes
              will be restricted to represent smaller subproblems than their parent.
              After <c>branch1</c> and <c>branch2</c> have been executed
              <c>this</c> is on top of the node stack of both child nodes, that
              is, both child nodes will continue branching according to the same rule.
              In summary, the above example creates branches described
              <c>branch1</c> and <c>branch2</c> and continues in both
              branches to control the same search strategy <c>this</c>.</p>
              <p>
              If the default implementation of method <c>clone</c> is not
              adequate and the goal is to be used for parallel optimization,
              this method also needs to be implemented by the user.  Recall that the
              default <c>clone</c> method performs a shallow copy, so
              typically a user implementation would perform a deep copy for
              objects that should be local to threads or use the
              <c>synchronize</c> keyword where synchronization is required.

             <summary>
             Represents a node evaluator.
             </summary>
            <remarks>
             <p>Node evaluators can be used to control the node selection strategy
             during the branch-and-cut search.
             When <c>Cplex</c> finishes processing a node during
             branch-and-cut search it chooses a new active node from the tree to
             process.  Node evaluators allow
             you to implement your own node selection strategy
             within any subtree controlled by goals.</p>
             <p>
             Node evaluators are represented by objects of type
             <c>Cplex.NodeEvaluator</c>. To create your own node evaluator,
             you must subclass class <c>Cplex.NodeEvaluator</c> and implement
             the abstract method <c>evaluate</c>.</p>
             <p>
             The <c>evaluate</c> method is called by <c>Cplex</c> to
             compute a value for a given node.  Given two nodes being evaluated by the
             same evaluator, by default <c>Cplex</c> chooses the node with the
             lower value.  However, this default behavior can be changed by
             overriding the method <c>subsume</c>.</p>
             <p>
             If the default implementation of the method <c>clone</c> is not
             adequate and the goal is to be used for parallel optimization,
             this method also needs to be implemented by the user.  Recall that the
             default <c>clone</c> method performs a shallow copy, so
             typically a user implementation would perform a deep copy for
             objects that should be local to threads or use the
             <c>synchronize</c> keyword where synchronization is required.
             </p>
             <p>
             The method <c>Cplex.Apply</c> is used to impose a node selection
             strategy defined by a node evaluator on the search controlled by a goal,
             as shown in this example:</p>
             <p>
             <pre>
               Cplex.Goal evalGoal = cplex.Apply(goal, nodeEval);
             </pre>
             </p><p>
             In this example <c>nodeEval</c> is of type
             <c>Cplex.NodeEvaluator</c> and <c>goal</c> is of type
             <c>Cplex.Goal</c>.
             The method <c>apply</c> creates and
             returns a new goal that follows the node selection rule defined by
             <c>nodeEval</c> while performing branch-and-cut search as specified
             by <c>goal</c>.  In doing so, the node selection strategy defined by
             <c>nodeEval</c> is active only for the search subtree generated by
             <c>goal</c>.</p>
             <p>
             These conditions also mean that as soon as the goal stack
             becomes empty and <c>Cplex</c> proceeds with
             built-in search strategies, the node
             selection control by means of node evaluators is deactivated,
             and the built-in strategy controlled by the parameter
             <c>Cplex.IntParam.NodeSel</c> is
             used instead.  In order for you to maintain control
             over the node selection by means of
             node evaluators while using the <c>Cplex</c> branch strategy,
             you can use a goal such as this one:</p>
             <p>
             <c>
                  class DefaultSearchGoal extends Cplex.Goal {
                    public Cplex.Goal execute(Cplex cplex) throws ILOG.Concert.Exception {
                      if (!isIntegerFeasible())
                        return cplex.And(cplex.BranchAsCplex(), this);
                      return null;
                    }
                  }
             </c>
             </p><p>
             An interesting implication of the correspondence between node evaluators
             and goals is that you can specify different node selection strategies for
             different subtrees.  If <c>goal1</c> and <c>goal2</c> define
             the search in two subtrees of a branch-and-cut search tree, and
             <c>eval1</c> and <c>eval2</c> define two
             different node selection schemes, the following goal
             will put the subtree defined by <c>goal1</c> under the node
             selection strategy of <c>eval1</c> and the subtree defined by
             <c>goal2</c> under the node selection strategy
             of <c>eval2</c>.
             </p>
             <p><c>
              cplex.Or(cplex.Apply(goal1, eval1),
                       cplex.Apply(goal2, eval2));
             </c></p><p>
             To understand better how multiple node evaluators are handled, consider
             this additional information about the management of evaluators.  When an
             evaluator is applied to a goal, the evaluator is attached to every node
             that will be created by that goal.  This not only includes the nodes
             created by the <c>execute</c> method of the goal itself, but also
             those created by the goal returned by the <c>execute</c> method
             and so on.  Since the <c>execute</c> method of a goal may create
             and return goals with other evaluators applied to them, every node may
             have a list of evaluators attached to it.  The order of evaluators is the
             order in which the evaluators have been applied.</p>
             <p>
             Each evaluator computes a value for every node it is attached to by
             calling the method <c>evaluate</c>. This method is called only once
             for a node and the result is stored.  If a node evaluates to
             <c>Double.MAX_VALUE</c> (by means of an evaluator's method
             <c>evaluate</c>), the node is pruned from the tree, or, in other
             words, the node is removed from the tree along with the entire subtree
             that otherwise might have been generated from it.</p>
             <p>
             When <c>Cplex</c> chooses the next node to be processed it starts
             out with a candidate proposed by the built-in node selection strategy.
             There is a variety of such strategies that can be chosen with
             the parameter <c>Cplex.IntParam.NodeSel</c>.</p>
             <p>
             After choosing an initial candidate node, <c>Cplex</c> goes
             through the list of remaining nodes in the branch-and-cut tree to see if
             a node evaluator overrules this decision.  Thus, for each active node
             <c>Cplex</c> checks all the evaluators it has in common with the
             current candidate.  By default, if a common evaluator computed a lower
             number for a node than for the current candidate, that node is used as a
             new candidate.  However, by overriding the <c>subsume</c>
             method, a different overruling criterion can be implemented.  The
             evaluators are checked in the order they are listed in the candidate
             node. This operation is repeated
             until all nodes have been checked.  The candidate
             that survives this process will be chosen as the node to be processed
             for branch-and-cut search.</p></remarks>

              processed.  Given two nodes controlled by one evaluator, by default,
              the evaluator chooses the node with the lower evaluation value.
              However, this can be changed by overriding the method

              to all other active nodes.  If a given node and the candidate node are
              governed by the same evaluator, <c>Cplex</c> calls the
              method <c>subsume</c> to determine whether the node should become
              the new candidate.  The arguments passed to the subsume call are the

             Represents a limit of the search to a specified subtree.
             </summary>
            <remarks>
             <p>This class allows you to limit the branch-and-cut search
             within certain subtrees.  For example, you may consider doing so in order
             to limit the number of branches or nodes to use when
             exploring a certain decision.  Such search limits can be implemented in
             the context of <c>Cplex</c> goals by means of
             <c>Cplex.SearchLimit</c> objects.</p>
             <p>
             To create your own search limit, you must subclass
             <c>Cplex.SearchLimit</c> and implement the method
             <c>check</c>.  You may optionally implement the method
             <c>init</c>.</p> <p>
             Also, if the default implementation of method <c>clone</c> is not
             adequate and the goal is to be used for parallel optimization,
             this method needs also be implemented by the user.  Recall that the
             default <c>clone</c> method performs a shallow copy, so
             typically a user implementation would perform a deep copy for
             objects that should be local to threads or use the
             <c>synchronize</c> keyword where synchronization is required.
             </p>
             <p>
             Prior to calling the methods <c>check</c> or <c>init</c>,
             <c>Cplex</c> initializes the search limit object as the node
             for which to determine whether a search limit
             has been encountered.  This node is referred to as the current node.</p>
             <p>
             The method <c>check</c> must be implemented in such a way that it
             returns <c>true</c> if the limit has been reached and
             <c>false</c> otherwise.  Information about the current node can
             be queried through the protected API of the class
             <c>Cplex.SearchLimit</c>.</p>
             <p>
             Before the method <c>check</c> is called for the first time, the
             virtual method <c>init</c> is called at that node.  This method is
             called only once and allows you to initialize the search limit.  As for
             the method <c>check</c>, information about the current node can
             be queried through the protected API of class
             <c>Cplex.SearchLimit</c>.</p>
             <p>
             The method <c>Cplex.LimitSearch</c> is used to create a goal
             that imposes a limit on a search controlled by a goal, as shown in this
             example:
             </p>
             <p>
             <pre>
               Cplex.Goal limitGoal = cplex.LimitSearch(goal1, limit);
             </pre>
             </p>
             <p>
             In this example <c>limit</c> is of type
             <c>Cplex.SearchLimit</c> and <c>goal1</c> is of type
             <c>Cplex.Goal</c>.
             The method <c>Cplex.LimitSearch</c>
             creates and returns a new goal that performs branch-and-cut search as
             specified by <c>goal1</c> until the limit specified by
             <c>limit</c> is reached.  In doing so, the search limit defined by
             <c>limit</c> is active only for the search subtree generated by
             <c>goal1</c>. For example, if you created two branches with the goal
             </p>
             <p>
             <pre>
               cplex.Or(limitGoal, goal2);
             </pre>
             </p><p>
             only the subtree defined by <c>goal1</c> is subjected to the
             search limit <c>limit</c>, while the subtree defined by
             <c>goal2</c> is not.
             </p><p>
             The possibility of specifying search limits for subtrees leads to the
             possible situation where certain branches are subject to more than one
             search limit. Nodes with multiple search limits attached to them are
             processed only if none of the search limits has been reached, or, in other
             words, if all the search limits return <c>false</c> when the
             <c>check</c> method is called by <c>Cplex</c>.
             </p><p>
             The fact that search limits are tied to goals implies that as soon as
             the goal stack becomes empty and <c>Cplex</c> proceeds with
             built-in search strategies, the search limit is deactivated. In order to
             impose a search limit while using a built-in <c>Cplex</c>
             branch strategy, a goal such as the following one can be used.
             </p><p>
             <pre>
               class DefaultSearchGoal extends Cplex.Goal {
                 public Cplex.Goal execute(Cplex cplex) throws ILOG.Concert.Exception {
                   if (!isIntegerFeasible())
                     return cplex.And(cplex.BranchAsCplex(), this);
                   return null;
                 }
               }

              <p>This method is called for the current node to check whether the

             <c>Cplex.LimitSearch</c> is
             executed, <c>Cplex</c> calls this method after initializing

             method, users can initialize the search limit object.</p>
             <p>
             The method <c>init</c> is called only once for a limit.  This
             convention
             makes it generally not possible to use one limit object in two
             subtrees, because <c>init</c> would be called only in one
             subtree and thus the limit would not be correctly initialized for
             the other subtree.  Use two separate instances of your limit
             instead to overcome this convention.</p></remarks>

            <remarks>It makes the native code simple (don't have require a global ref).
            2. Another simplicifation in the native code is that we can just call
               CplexI.InvokeGenericCallback() whenever the callback is invoked.
               This way we can do all the heavy lifting in Java.
            3. We have to install/uninstall the callback before/after each solve
               to that even after modifying _lp (for example for importing a new
               model) we still have the same callback setting and can apply it.</remarks>

             A class for modeling assistance.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             <p>
             This class provides a namespace for the modeling assistance callback
             interface (see <c>ModelingAssistance.Callback</c>). For each
             invocation of the callback, a modeling information ID and warning
             string are provided (see the
             <c>ModelingAssistance.Callback.Invoke</c> method).
             </p>
            
             <p>
             This class also exposes modeling information IDs as defined by the
             CPLEX Callable Library. These constants define symbolic names for the
             integer modeling information IDs returned by the Callable Library
             (C API). The names to which the modeling information IDs are assigned
             are the same names used in the Callable Library except that the
             leading CPXMI characters have been left out. For example, the
             <c>ModelingAssistance.BIGM_COEF</c> constant corresponds with
             the <c>CPXMI_BIGM_COEF</c> macro in the Callable Library. The
             modeling information IDs are accessible through the modeling
             assistance callback. These symbolic names can be used to test if a
             particular modeling issue has been detected.

             <p>
             If an object is registered with CPLEX by means of the method
             <c>Cplex.Use(ModelingAssistance.Callback)</c>, then CPLEX
             will invoke this function of the registered object for each
             modeling assistance warning. These warnings will not be
             displayed in the engine log as they are by default when no
             callback is registered. For values of <c>issueid</c>, see
             the constants in <c>ModelingAssistance</c>.
             </p>
            
             <p>
             Note: CPLEX will only invoke this function if the CPLEX
             parameter <c>Cplex.Param.Read.DataCheck</c> is set to
             <c>Cplex.DataCheck.Assist</c>.  In addition, the
             parameter <c>Cplex.Param.Read.WarningLimit</c>
             controls the number of times each type of modeling assistance
             warning will be reported (the rest will be ignored). See
             <c>CPX_PARAM_DATACHECK</c> and
